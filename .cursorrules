# PROJECT OVERVIEW
HandyRides, Inc. is a Django-based web application designed to help event attendees find and coordinate shared rides. The application focuses on events where participants go through a pre-registration process and have a common destination with defined start and end times. Users can search for other registrants by location to find potential ride-sharing partners, making transportation more economical and social. The platform aims to integrate with event registration platforms like eVite and leverage attendee data to facilitate carpooling.
